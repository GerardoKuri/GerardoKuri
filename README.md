- 👋 Hi, I’m @GerardoKuri, a Salvadoran with a master's in AI that wants to keep learning ALWAYS.
- 👀 I’m interested in building a community of data scientists for me to keep learning about the latest data science techniques 
in a world where this skill becomes more and more indispensable 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about database structures due that, in my master's in AI I think this area wasn't focused and analyzed enough
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data Science projects which contribute to my technical skills and, of course, give me a portfolio for me to compete internationally in the future
- 📫 You can reach as @DevKaluco on telegram or at my email gjkm95@gmail.com
